## E-commerce API with Node.js

This project implements a RESTful API for an e-commerce platform, allowing users to perform various operations such as browsing products, managing carts, and placing orders.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize (for interacting with the database)
- MySQL or PostgreSQL (for the database)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- dotenv for managing environment variables

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-api.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd e-commerce-api
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:

   - Create a database in MySQL or PostgreSQL.
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the database credentials.

4. Run the migration to create the database schema:

   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API Documentation

The API documentation can be found in the `docs` folder. You can view the documentation by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Endpoints

- `/api/categories`: Get a list of categories.
- `/api/products`: Get a list of products or search products by category.
- `/api/products/:id`: Get details of a specific product.
- `/api/cart`: Manage the user's cart (add, update, remove items).

- `/api/orders/:id`: Get details of a specific order.
- `/api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `/api/auth/login`: Log in and obtain an authentication token.

## Security

- User passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storing in the database.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication.

## Error Handling

- The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for different scenarios.

## Rate Limiting

- Rate limiting is not implemented in this version of the API but can be added for preventing abuse.

## Deployment

- The API can be deployed to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure. Remember to set the necessary environment variables for production.
